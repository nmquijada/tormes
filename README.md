## What is TORMES?

TORMES is an open-source, user-friendly pipeline for whole bacterial genome sequencing (WGS) analysis directly from raw Illumina paired-end sequenceing data. TORMES work with every bacterial WGS dataset, regardless the number, origin or species. By following very simple instructions, TORMES automates all steps included in a typical WGS analysis, including:  

1) Sequence quality filtering
2) *De novo* genome assembly
3) Draft genome ordering against a reference (optional)
4) Genome annotation
5) Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST, optional)
6) Antibiotic resistance genes screening
7) Virulence genes screening
8) Pangenome comparison (optional)

When working with *Escherichia* or *Salmonella* sequence data, extensive analysis can be enabled (by using the `-g/--genera` option), including:

9) Antibiotic resistance screening based on point mutations
10) Plasmid replicons screening
11) Serotyping
12) fimH-Typing (only for *Escherichia*)

Once the WGS analysis is ended, TORMES summarizes the results in an interactive web-like file that can be opened in any web browser, making the results easy to analyze, compare and share.  

<br>

TORMES is written in a combination of Bash, R and R Markdown. Once the WGS is ended, TORMES will automatically generate a RMarkdown file (unique for each analysis) that will be use to render the report in R environment. This file is susceptible for user's modification and the generation of user-specific reports (by including additional information, tables, figures, *etc.*). Additional information can be found in the [Rendering customized reports](#rendering-customized-reports) section. We will probrably transition TORMES code (Bash) to use [SnakeMake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), in order to make the pipeline also susceptible for user customization.   
TORMES is a pipeline, and for its use it is necessary the utilization of a lot of bioinformatic tools that constitutes the backbone of TORMES and that are listed in the [Required dependencies](#required-dependencies) section.  
We think that the availability of open-source, user-friendly pipelines, will broaden the application of certain technologies, such as WGS, sometimes limited by the analysis of the great amount of data that is generated by high-throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) platforms. TORMES was devised with this aim, inspired by some excellent currently available software, such as [Nullarbor](https://github.com/tseemann/nullarbor), [EnteroBase](https://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk/) and the [Center for Genomic Epidemiology](https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/). Users are encouraged to use every tool available and to find those that better fit in their studies.  
We would like TORMES to be regularly updated with the most novel tools and databases, and to improve the pipeline taking into account users' suggestions. Currently, we are working in the following improvements:  
- Possibility to start the pipeline from (draft) genomes.
- Extend the pipeline to data generated by other HTS platforms.
- Include additional analysis for *Staphylococcus aureus* (by using the `-g/--genera` option).
- Include the use of customized databases.

<br>

## Installation

TORMES is a pipeline that requries a lot of dependenices to work. It has been devised to be used as a conda environment. For installing TORMES an all its dependencies run:  

```
wget https://anaconda.org/nmquijada/tormes-1.0/2019.04.25.180147/download/tormes-1.0.yml
conda env create -n tormes-1.0 --file tormes-1.0.yml
```
<br>

To activate TORMES environment run:  

```
conda activate tormes-1.0
```
<br>

Additionally, the first time you are using TORMES, run (after activating TORMES environment):

```
tormes-setup
```

This step will install additional dependencies not available in conda, including the [MiniKrakenDB_8GB](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/) required by Kraken to work (the database size is ~8GB and might take some time to download). Additionally it will automatically create the **config_file.txt** required for TORMES to work (see below).

```
<br>

### Obligatory options
A metadata text file is needed for TORMES to work by using the `-m/--metadata` option. This file will include all the information regarding the sample and requires an specific organization:  
 - Columns should be tab separated.
 - First column must me called `Samples` and harbor samples names (avoid special characters).
 - Second column must be called `Read1` and harbor the path to the R1 (forward) reads (either fastq or fastq.gz).
 - Third column must be called `Read2` and harbor the path to the R2 (reverse) reads (either fastq or fastq.gz).
 - Fourth (and so on) columns are descriptive. The information included here is not needed for TORMES to work but will be included in the interactive report. You can add as many description columns as needed (including information such as isolation date or source, different codification of each sample, *etc*.).
 
<br>

This is an example of how the metadata file should looks like:  

Samples | Read1 | Read2 | Description1 | Description2 |
------- | ----- | ----- | ------------ | ------------ |
Sample1 | Forward read location | Reverse read location | Description 1 of Sample 1 | Description 2 of Sample 1 |
Sample2 | Forward read location | Reverse read location | Description 1 of Sample 2 | Description 2 of Sample 2 |

<br>

If problems are encountered when performing the metadata file, you can generate a template metadata file by typing: `tormes example-metadata`.  
This command will generate a file called `samples_metadata.txt` in your working directory that can be used as a template for your own dataset.

<br>

## Output
TORMES stores every file generated during the analysis is different directories regarding the step within the analysis (assembly, annotation, *etc.*), all of them included within the main output directory specified with the `-o/--output` option:  

- **annotation**: one directory per sample containing all the annotation files generated by [Prokka](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka).
- **antibiotic_resistance_genes**: results of the scrrening for antibiotic resistance genes by using [Abricate](https://github.com/tseemann/abricate) against three databases: ARG-ANNOT, CARD and ResFinder.
- **assembly**: files resulting from genome assembly with [SPAdes](http://cab.spbu.ru/software/spades/) or [Megahit](https://github.com/voutcn/megahit) (in gzipped directories, to unzip them type `tar xzf file-name.tgz`) and the assembly stats generated with [Quast](http://quast.sourceforge.net/quast).
- **cleaned_reads**: reads that survived after quality filtering using [Prinseq](http://prinseq.sourceforge.net/), [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic) or [Sickle](https://github.com/najoshi/sickle).
- **draft_genomes**: stores the draft genomes. If the `-r/--reference` option is used, draft genomes will be ordered against a reference by using [Mauve](http://darlinglab.org/mauve/mauve.html) and stored here. Contigs < 200 bp are removed.
- **mlst**: results of Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) by using [mlst](https://github.com/tseemann/mlst).
- **pangenome**: results of pangenome comparison based on the presence/absence of genes between the samples by using [Roary](https://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Roary/).
- **report_files.tgz**: files necessary for the generation of the interactive web-like report. See further instructions here.
- **sequencing_assembly_report.txt**: tabulated file including information of the sequencing (number of reads, average read length, sequencing depth), the assembly (number of contigs, genome length, average contig length, N50, GC content) and consensus taxonomic assignment.
- **species_identification**: consensus taxonomic assignment of each sample by using [Kraken](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/).
- **tormes.log**: log file of TORMES analysis progress.
- **tormes_report.html**: web-interactive report generated automatically after WGS analysis that summarizes the results. Can be open in any browser, shared and analyzed in a simple way.
- **virulence_genes**: results of the scrrening for virulence genes by using [Abricate](https://github.com/tseemann/abricate) against the [Virulence Factors Database](http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/).

<br>

Once the WGS analysis is ended, TORMES summarizes the results in a interactive web-like report file. An example of a report file can be visualized [here](https://nmquijada.github.io/tormes/files/).  
For the generation of the report file, `tormes` calls `tormes-report` (included in the TORMES pipeline) that generates a *rmarkdown* file (in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) environment), called `tormes_report.Rmd`, that can be modified by the user for the generation of customized reports without the need of re-running the entire analysis. 

<br>

## Rendering customized reports

Reports are generated after rendering the "**tormes_report.Rmd**" file in R environment. This file is automatically generated after TORMES WGS analysis is ended and it is unique for each study. The file is written in R Markdown code and it can be manually modified and used for the generation of customized reports.  
R Markdown is a file format for creating dynamic documents with R. Excellent documentation about this format is already available in the [R Markdown from R Studio webpage](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). The R Markdown [Reference Guide](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) and [Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf) are also recommended.  
The user is encouraged to modify the "**tormes_report.Rmd**" file for the generation of user-customized reports by following the guidelines above. Once the "**tormes_report.Rmd**" file has been modified, it can be used to render a new report by using the following command in the same directory (TORMES environment might be activated):  

<br>

```
Rscript -e 'library(rmarkdown); rmarkdown::render("tormes_report.Rmd", "html_document", encoding="UTF-8")'
```

<br>

This command will generate a new "**tormes_report.html**".  
**Please note** that all the information (tables, figures, *etc.*) that is wanted to be included in the report file, **need** to be in the same directory as the "tormes_report.Rmd" file.

<br>

## Open-source and networking community

TORMES was devised with the aim of being an open-source and easy tool that everybody can use for their WGS experiments. Bacterial bioinformatics is developing rapidly, and the availability of open code and tools is crucial for the scientific community to benefit from these developments.  

Additionally, TORMES is intended to be a networking project with users providing their feedback and personal experience so that TORMES can become a more complete pipeline including as many analyses and genera as possible.  
There’s been almost a year since we launch this tool and we are very happy with the responses of the community. Most of the suggestions are considered for further improvements of the TORMES pipeline and some users have also shared their code that could be used to extend TORMES analysis and/or to overcome some issues/challenges.  
We are working for a finer tool for WGS that can be freely provided to the community and definitively the feedback from users is being pivotal.

- In this issue - https://github.com/nmquijada/tormes/issues/16 - [**@biobrad**](https://github.com/biobrad) greatly compiles some of the issues he has run through when running TORMES and shares instructions on how to solve them.  
- Additionally, [**@biobrad**](https://github.com/biobrad) has developed [**Tormesbot**]( https://github.com/biobrad/tormesbot/wiki/Tormesbot), a tool to assist other microbiologists who are not computer savvy in manipulating the metadata and parsing arguments to a HPC environment.
